# Data-cleaning-on-excel
Sales data cleaning.

First, I downloaded sales data from chatgpt .After downloading the data by using excel I cleaned the data.
I removed the duplicate cells but using "Remove Duplicate".
I converted date column in Date format.
After that I treated the missing values (Customer Name,Product Name,Payment mode and Region)with "NA" and filled the null column of Quantity,Unit price and sales by entering the required values.
Then I Renamed column and I changed the cases in proper case and deleted the extra spaces and changed the cell types.
In that way I cleaned and prepared the sales data.
